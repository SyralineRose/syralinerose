## 🔍 Overview  
This room introduces the defender’s perspective in cybersecurity. It explains what defensive (blue team) work involves, the importance of monitoring and detection, and introduces tools and practices for keeping systems safe.

## 📝 Notes  

### Key Concepts  
- **Defensive Security (Blue Team)** → focuses on protecting systems, detecting threats, and responding to incidents.  
- **Monitoring** → using logs, alerts, and tools to spot suspicious activity.  
- **Incident Response** → structured process for containing, investigating, and recovering from attacks.  

### Tools & Practices Mentioned  
- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** tools collect and analyse logs from across a network (e.g. Splunk, ELK).  
- **Antivirus & Firewalls** are part of the defensive toolkit, but proactive monitoring is just as important.  
- **Threat Intelligence** helps defenders understand what attackers are doing “in the wild.”  

### Observations  
- I liked how the room contrasted **attack vs. defend** — offensive looks for gaps, defensive closes them.  
- It made me realise how important logs are — defenders don’t “see” the attack directly, they piece it together from evidence.  
- This perspective will help me later when I’m doing offensive rooms, because I’ll know what defenders are looking for.

## 🧩 Key Takeaways  
- Defensive security is about **visibility**, you can’t defend what you can’t see.  
- Logs and monitoring tools are the defender’s main weapon.  
- Understanding both attacker and defender perspectives builds a more complete skillset.
