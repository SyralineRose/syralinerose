## Hi, I'm Syraline Rose! A Cyber Security Student, TryHackMe enthusiast and starting security labs projects that link my passions.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning the basics of programming in order to achieve my goals of becoming a pen tester.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a personal project that explores how attackers exploit game servers and how defenders stop them. I think it will be a perfect purple project that will help me explore both sides
- âš¡ Fun fact: I speak two languages, French and English
